/**
 * Shortest Word Distance II:
 *
 * This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance.
 * The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters.
 * How would you optimize it?
 Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and
 implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and
 return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 For example,
 Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
 Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
