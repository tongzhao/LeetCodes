/**
 * Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty,
 * flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

 For example:
 Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},
 1
 / \
 2 3
 / \
 4 5

 return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].
