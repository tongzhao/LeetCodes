/**
 * 351. Android Unlock Patterns
 *
 * Explanation:
 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
 Invalid move: 4 - 1 - 3 - 6
 Line 1 - 3 passes through key 2 which had not been selected in the pattern.

 Invalid move: 4 - 1 - 9 - 2
 Line 1 - 9 passes through key 5 which had not been selected in the pattern.

 Valid move: 2 - 4 - 1 - 3 - 6
 Line 1 - 3 is valid because it passes through key 2, which had been selected in the pattern

 Valid move: 6 - 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 2
 Line 1 - 9 is valid because it passes through key 5, which had been selected in the pattern.

 Example:
 Given m = 1, n = 1, return 9.
